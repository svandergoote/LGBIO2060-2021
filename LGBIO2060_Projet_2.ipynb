The patient's health status is represented by the vector $S$, where each value $s_t$ represents the patient's status in day $t$. The government also provides you with transition probabilities between each state that they have estimated based on data from the national public health department *Sciensano*. \\\\\n",
        "The measurements they give you are the blood oxygen levels measured each day for a patient. We will hypothesize that patients with covid or flu status have a lower rate than someone in good health.\n",
