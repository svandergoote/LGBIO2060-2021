Patients can be in one of the three following states : healthy, covid or flu. The patient's health status is represented by the vector $S$, where each value $s_t$ represents the patient's status in day $t$. The government also provides you with transition probabilities between each state that they have estimated based on data from the national public health department *Sciensano*.\n",
