    "\n",
    "The most widely used continuous distribution is probably the Gaussian (also known as Normal) distribution. It is extremely common across all kinds of statistical analyses. Because of the central limit theorem, many quantities are Gaussian distributed. Gaussians also have some nice mathematical properties that permit simple closed-form solutions to several important problems. \n",

The **mean** $\\mu$, which sets the location of its center, and its \"scale\" or spread is controlled by its **standard deviation** $\\sigma$, or **variance** $\\sigma^2$ (i.e. the square of standard deviation). **Be careful not to use one when the other is required.**\n",
