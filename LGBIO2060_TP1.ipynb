Basically if we do the below code without that 0, we would get different random numbers every time we run it. By setting the seed to 0, we ensure we will get the same random numbers.

    "\n",
    "The most widely used continuous distribution is probably the Gaussian (also known as Normal) distribution. It is extremely common across all kinds of statistical analyses. Because of the central limit theorem, many quantities are Gaussian distributed. Gaussians also have some nice mathematical properties that permit simple closed-form solutions to several important problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a working example, imagine that a human participant is asked to point in the direction where they perceived a sound coming from. As an approximation, we can assume that the variability in the direction/orientation they point towards is Gaussian distributed.\n",

    "In this exercise, you will implement a Gaussian by filling in the missing portions of code for the function `my_gaussian` below. Gaussians have two parameters. The **mean** $\\mu$, which sets the location of its center, and its \"scale\" or spread is controlled by its **standard deviation** $\\sigma$, or **variance** $\\sigma^2$ (i.e. the square of standard deviation). **Be careful not to use one when the other is required.**\n",

You therefore need to explicitly normalize it to sum to one yourself based on the `step_size` used. \n",
