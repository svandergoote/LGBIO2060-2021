        "In this tutorial we will make the previous models a little more complex. Until now, we have used binary or continuous variables whose state was fixed in time. It is easy to see that this greatly limits our ability to represent real systems. One way to get closer to reality would be to allow our hidden states to change their values. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take the example of the fish. Previously they were either on the right or on the left. But now, we will add to the model the fact that fishes can switch side. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is exactly what **Hidden markov models** permits. The Markov property specifies that you can fully encapsulate the important properties of a system based on its current state at the current time, any previous history does not matter. It is memoryless. Back to the fishes, it means that the school of fish is only at one position at a time and the probability of them being on the left or on the right at time *t* depends only on the state at time *t-1* and the probabilities of transition from one state to another. It can be represented with a matrix called the **transition matrix**.\n",
