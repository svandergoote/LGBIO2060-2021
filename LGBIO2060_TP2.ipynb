        "You need to decide where to fish. It may seem obvious - you could just fish on the side where the probability of the fish being is higher! Unfortunately, decisions and actions are always a little more complicated. Deciding to fish may be influenced by more than just the probability of the school of fish being there as we saw by the potential issues of submarines and sunburn. The consequences of the action you take is based on the true (but hidden) state of the world and the action you choose! In our example, fishing on the wrong side, where there aren't many fish, is likely to lead to you spending your afternoon not catching fish and therefore getting a sunburn. The submarine represents a risk to fishing on the right side that is greater than the left side. If you want to know what to expect from taking the action of fishing on one side or the other, you need to calculate the expected utility.\n",

        "\n",
        "We quantify gains and losses numerically using a **utility** function $U(s,a)$, which describes the consequences of your actions: how much value you gain (or if negative, lose) given the state of the world ($s$) and the action you take ($a$). In our example, our utility can be summarized as:\n",

This allows us to choose actions by taking probabilities of events into account: we don't care if the outcome of an action-state pair is a loss if the probability of that state is very low. We can formalize this as:\n",

You can change the probability that the school of fish is on the left side,$p(s = \\textrm{left})$, using the slider. You will see the utility function (a matrix) in the middle and the corresponding expected utility for each action on the right.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, make sure you understand how the expected utility of each action is being computed from the probabilities and the utility values. In the initial state: the probability of the fish being on the left is 0.9 and on the right is 0.1. The expected utility of the action of fishing on the left is then $U(s = \\textrm{left},a = \\textrm{left})p(s = \\textrm{left}) + U(s = \\textrm{right},a = \\textrm{left})p(s = \\textrm{right}) = 2(0.9) + -2(0.1) = 1.6$. Essentially, to get the expected utility of action $a$, you are doing a weighted sum over the relevant column of the utility matrix (corresponding to action $a$) where the weights are the state probabilities.\n",

        "1.  You just arrived at the dock for the first time and have no sense of where the fish might be. So you guess that the probability of the school being on the left side is 0.5 (so the probability on the right side is also 0.5). Which side would you choose to fish on given our utility values?\n",
        "2.  You think that the probability of the school being on the left side is very low (0.1) and correspondingly high on the right side (0.9). Which side would you choose to fish on given our utility values?\n",
