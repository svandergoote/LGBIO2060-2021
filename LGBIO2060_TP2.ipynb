        "Bayesian inference is a method based on the Bayes theorem. It is method used to  combine prior knowledge and noisy measurements to infer an unknown state. The estimate obtained with the Bayes theorem is associated to some uncertainty (how confident we are that our estimate is true), and helps making a decision. \n",

        "Today, your going to the lake, hoping to catch some fishes. At the deck, you have to decide if you are going to fish on the left side or on the right side. To make this decision, you would want to know which side the school of fish is on to maximise your chances to catch a fish. As you cannot see directly where they are (the fishes's state is the latent variable that you're trying to estimate), you will have to base your decision on your previous knowledge (for example, you know that most of the time, fishes are on the left) and on a measurement (a fisherperson is on the right side of the deck and has caught a fish). Additionaly, by fishing on the right side of the deck, you'll have a higher probability of getting a sunburn, wich is not desirable. \n",

        "You need to decide where to fish. It may seem obvious - you could just fish on the side where the probability of the fish being is higher! Unfortunately, decisions and actions are always a little more complicated. Deciding to fish may be influenced by more than just the probability of the school of fish being there as we saw by the potential issues of submarines and sunburn. The consequences of the action you take is based on the true (but hidden) state of the world and the action you choose! In our example, fishing on the wrong side, where there aren't many fish, is likely to lead to you spending your afternoon not catching fish and therefore getting a sunburn. The submarine represents a risk to fishing on the right side that is greater than the left side. If you want to know what to expect from taking the action of fishing on one side or the other, you need to calculate the expected utility.\n",
        "\n",
        "You know the (prior) probability that the school of fish is on the left side of the dock today, $P(s = \\textrm{left})$. So, you also know the probability the school is on the right, $P(s = \\textrm{right})$, because these two probabilities must add up to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "We quantify gains and losses numerically using a **utility** function $U(s,a)$, which describes the consequences of your actions: how much value you gain (or if negative, lose) given the state of the world ($s$) and the action you take ($a$). In our example, our utility can be summarized as:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Utility: U(s,a)   | a = left   | a = right  |\n",
        "| ----------------- |------------|------------|\n",

        "| s = right         | -2         | +1         |\n",
        "\n",
        "To use possible gains and losses to choose an action, we calculate the **expected utility** of that action by weighing these utilities with the probability of that state occuring. This allows us to choose actions by taking probabilities of events into account: we don't care if the outcome of an action-state pair is a loss if the probability of that state is very low. We can formalize this as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\text{Expected utility of action a} = \\sum_{s}U(s,a)P(s) $$\n",
        "\n",

        "Let's start to get a sense of how all this works using the interactive demo below. You can change the probability that the school of fish is on the left side,$p(s = \\textrm{left})$, using the slider. You will see the utility function (a matrix) in the middle and the corresponding expected utility for each action on the right.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, make sure you understand how the expected utility of each action is being computed from the probabilities and the utility values. In the initial state: the probability of the fish being on the left is 0.9 and on the right is 0.1. The expected utility of the action of fishing on the left is then $U(s = \\textrm{left},a = \\textrm{left})p(s = \\textrm{left}) + U(s = \\textrm{right},a = \\textrm{left})p(s = \\textrm{right}) = 2(0.9) + -2(0.1) = 1.6$. Essentially, to get the expected utility of action $a$, you are doing a weighted sum over the relevant column of the utility matrix (corresponding to action $a$) where the weights are the state probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each of these scenarios, think and discuss first. Then use the demo to try out each and see if your action would have been correct (that is, if the expected value of that action is the highest).\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  You just arrived at the dock for the first time and have no sense of where the fish might be. So you guess that the probability of the school being on the left side is 0.5 (so the probability on the right side is also 0.5). Which side would you choose to fish on given our utility values?\n",
        "2.  You think that the probability of the school being on the left side is very low (0.1) and correspondingly high on the right side (0.9). Which side would you choose to fish on given our utility values?\n",
