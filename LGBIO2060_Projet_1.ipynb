        "About the data: \n",
        "* We simulated the data `F_true` and `F_estimated` for you. As in the paper `F_true` is drawn from two gaussian distributions that differ in their variance. Out of the 11 subjects, the first six experienced the wide distribution for the first two days and then the narrow distribution during day 3. It is the opposite for the last 5 subjects.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In contrast to the paper, `F_estimated` is not computed from the positional error but is artifically simulated.\n",
